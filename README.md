## You should use a monorepo

This is the repo for all of your prototyping experiments.

A monorepo solves the diamond dependency problem. A good codebase is reusable.

## Quickstart

### Setup

- Install Docker and start the Docker daemon.
- Create a `.env` file even if empty.

### Run

- To start a run: `make run`.
- To visualize data from the most recent run, navigate to `localhost:8001`

### Configure

- Place API keys in `.env`.
- Place other CLI arguments in `args` in the shell format.
  - On each line: `key=value`

### Other

- To run tests: `make test`
- To clean pycache and run outputs: `make clean`

## Logging

- Logs are timed by UTC.
- Each logger keeps its own log files under `out/$RUN_ID/log`.
- At the end of the run, each logger emits all its counters in its logs and in a
  JSON file aside its log files.
